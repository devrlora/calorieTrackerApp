## Problem Statement:
For people who want to watch the macro nutrient intake, and easily search multiple food items and calculate the total calories, fats and proteins of those items. 

## Proposition:
This app allows users to type the name of a food item, which then uses an API to search 
multiple instances matching the input text. The user can then add, remove, and manually update the returned data.The app will store some common items, with example data, which can be added to the total.

## Next Steps:
Connect api to database update functionality.
Add value totals functionality.
